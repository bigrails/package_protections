      # This inherits from `Sorbet::StrictSigil` and doesn't change any behavior of it.
      # The only reason we do this is so that configuration for this cop can live under a different cop namespace.
      # This prevents this cop's configuration from clashing with other configurations for the same cop.
      # A concrete example of this would be if a user is using this package protection to make sure public APIs are typed,
      # and separately the application as a whole requiring strict typing in certain parts of the application.
      #
      # To prevent problems associated with needing to manage identical configurations for the same cop, we simply call it
      # something else in the context of this protection.
      #
      # We can apply this same pattern if we want to use other cops in the context of package protections and prevent clashing.

            These files cannot have ANY Ruby files in the public API that are not typed strict or higher.
            This is failing because these files are in `.rubocop_todo.yml` under `#{cop_name}`.
            If you want to be able to ignore these files, you'll need to open the file's package's `package.yml` file and
            change `#{IDENTIFIER}` to `#{::PackageProtections::ViolationBehavior::FailOnNew.serialize}`

            See https://go/packwerk_cheatsheet_typed_api for more info.
